## Strapdown.js CDN using jsDelivr

[Strapdown.js](http://strapdownjs.com/) was not provided on the CDN. Currently this is solved by [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/).

Original `strapdown.js`. You replace this:

```
<script src="https://strapdownjs.com/v/0.2/strapdown.js"></script>
```

You get the original [Strapdown.js](https://github.com/arturadib/strapdown) v0.2 via jsDelivr:

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/arturadib/strapdown@gh-pages/v/0.2/strapdown.min.js"></script>
```

There are several more `Strapdown.js` in this project.
